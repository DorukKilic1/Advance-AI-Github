# Advance AI Projects


Codex is an app that is downloaded from the web made by OpenAI. It is a common tool for vibe coding. 
Vibe Coding is a coding method. It means to generate code with the usage of ai. The user tells the ai what they want to create and the agent meaning the ai writes it in the prefered code language. 

Vibe Codings use is increasing rapidly because of how much it accelerates the development of programming projects. Althought it is very efficent it also creates problems like severely increasing the length of the debugging process and decreases the programs security. 

A way of avoiding these disadvantages are checking every code the agent generated to fix its bugs and instead of giving the agent full ownership on the project, it should just be a tool to help the user which means the user will still be the one in charge.

Basically instead of just vibe coding the user is being assisted by the agent and keeps full ownership of the project, making vibe coding a lot more effective while also removing it's disadvantages.

1) I opened the codex's official site from my web browser.
2) I went to the download page, found mac compatible version since i am working from a mac and pressed download to start the downloading process.
3) After downloading the file I opened it with finder. Clicking on the file created a new tab which wanted me to drag the codex icon to the folder called applications in order to add it to my applications. I did that and it added the app to my computer.

5) I opened codex and started setting it up by
- Logging in with my google account.
- Giving the required permissions to the app (Viewing, modifying the files on my computer, et cetera).

6) I opened a new folder on my desktop called Triangle App which will later store everthing that I made with codex.
